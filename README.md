# 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Example 4:

Input: root = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 5:

Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: [2,1]

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
